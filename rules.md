- When using Context7, make sure that
you keep the range of output in the
range 2k to 10k based on what you think
is the best.

- Maintain a file named library.md to
store the Library IDs that you search
for and before searching make sure that
you check the file and use the library
ID already available. Otherwise, search
for it.

- On Windows systems, avoid using `&&` to chain commands as it may cause errors.
  Instead, use semicolons `;` to separate multiple commands in a single line.
  Example: `git add . ; git commit -m "message" ; git push`
